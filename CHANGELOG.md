# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Changes

- CLI packages now require Node.js 22 or newer, dropping the EOL Node 20 runtime floor.

## 0.20.0 - 2026-06-06

### Changes

- CLI/API: replace local `clawhub scan` uploads with stored submitted-version scan report downloads, including owner-authorized `clawhub scan download <name> --version <version>` support for blocked skill and plugin submissions.

## 0.19.2 - 2026-06-05

### Fixes

- CLI: accept the legacy `clawhub skill verify --json` flag as a hidden compatibility no-op while continuing to print JSON by default.

## 0.19.1 - 2026-06-05

### Fixes

- CLI: install source-backed GitHub skills from the deployed `/api/v1/skills/:slug/install` resolver so `clawhub install` works for skills without hosted ClawHub versions.

## 0.19.0 - 2026-06-03

### Changes

- CLI/API: add authenticated `clawhub scan` submit/poll support for ephemeral local skill bundles and owner-authorized published skill scans, including JSON output and report ZIP downloads (#2479).

### Fixes

- Auth/Ops: keep GitHub account-age lookups on immutable numeric IDs, retry without auth when a configured GitHub token is rejected, and add an operator backfill for missing cached account ages.
- API/CLI: report Skill Card verification with flattened skill/version metadata, ClawScan verdict fields at `security.*`, and supporting scanner evidence under `security.signals`.

## 0.18.0 - 2026-05-25

### Changes

- CLI/API: add Skill Card verification surfaces, including `clawhub skill verify <slug>` JSON output and `--card` Markdown retrieval (#2382).
- Web/API: surface an "API key required" attribute on skills so listings, cards, and detail views show whether a skill needs an LLM API key, with publish-time inference from skill prompts and metadata (#2353) (thanks @momothemage).

### Fixes

- API: fix `GET /api/v1/skills` pagination so `cursor` advances to the next page instead of repeating the first page for supported non-trending sorts (#2275) (thanks @vyctorbrzezowski, @enerj).
- Web: block collaborative membership on personal publishers while allowing the linked owner to clean up stale extra membership rows (thanks @vyctorbrzezowski).
- Security/API: hide owned package/plugin catalog entries, revoke package publish tokens, and restore only matching ban-hidden packages on user unban (thanks @vyctorbrzezowski).
- API: block public raw skill files when moderation already blocks downloads and reject skill tags that point at another skill's version (thanks @vyctorbrzezowski).
- Web: stop stale unban restore batches from reactivating skills after the owner is banned again or deactivated (thanks @vyctorbrzezowski).
- Security/API: reject direct skill owner transfers when the skill is hidden, suspicious, or malicious (thanks @vyctorbrzezowski).

## 0.16.0 - 2026-05-18

### Fixes

- CLI/API: make package publishes robust under parallel same-publisher release jobs by avoiding unnecessary shared publisher writes, retrying transient Convex contention, and labeling contention separately from package validation failures (#2291).
- Security: move upload ClawScan classification to a GitHub Actions Codex worker, treat VirusTotal as telemetry-only signal, and trust verified `@openclaw/*` plugin packages by default.
- Security: cancel pending skill ownership transfers before rejecting accept attempts when the requester is inactive or the skill is hidden, removed, or malicious (#2276, #2277) (thanks @vyctorbrzezowski).
- API/CLI: fix package delete returning 500 for packages with capability tags when no capability search digest row existed yet (#2212) (thanks @momothemage).
- API: return a clear 400 for `/api/v1/packages/search` without a non-empty `q` instead of treating `search` as a package name (thanks @vyctorbrzezowski).
- Web/API: keep search results limited to items with match evidence, preserve trust and popularity as tie-breakers, and show `N+` counts without exact count queries (#2206) (thanks @vyctorbrzezowski).
- Web: preserve `ownerHandle` through legacy skill publish redirects so org admins land in the correct new-version owner context (#2177).
- Settings: save display name/bio changes even when a legacy personal publisher handle conflict prevents publisher profile sync (#1199).
- Auth: show a visible error if the GitHub sign-in request fails before the provider redirect starts (#2197).
- Schema: include `.tsv`, `.conf`, `.properties`, and `.dat` in the exported text-file allowlist and regenerate the committed schema package runtime (#2172, #874) (thanks @alexuser).

- API/docs: document v1 plain-text error responses and expose owner metadata in the OpenAPI search result schema (#2187) (thanks @vyctorbrzezowski).
- Web: rank publisher card preview items by downloads instead of recent publish order (thanks @vyctorbrzezowski).
- Web: remove the desktop Files tab height cap and make mobile truncation explicit (thanks @vyctorbrzezowski).
- Web: keep skill/plugin detail tabs at mobile-friendly touch target height.

### Changes

- Admin/Ops: audit profile syncs, self-service account/profile changes, personal publisher syncs, and org trusted-publisher changes so slug and ownership investigations have a complete ledger.
- Dependencies: update production `@clack/prompts`, `tailwind-merge`, and `yaml` dependencies (#2198).

## 0.15.0 - 2026-05-12

- Web: rename the skills and plugins browse alternate view from Cards to Grid while keeping legacy `view=cards` URLs compatible (#2119) (thanks @vyctorbrzezowski).
- Dev docs: refresh generated Convex AI guidance files (#2000).

### Fixes

- Moderation: stop treating VirusTotal Code Insight/Palm verdicts as a hide authority for skills; real AV-engine hits and ClawScan findings still contribute moderation verdicts.
- Moderation: stop treating static suspicious-only findings as a verdict; keep file/line evidence for review while VT/LLM decide public suspicious status.
- ClawScan: reduce false positives for scoped uninstall cleanup, declared provider login flows, Basic Auth/base64 handling, and user-directed provider uploads while hard-blocking stealth browser abuse patterns.
- ClawScan: lower false positives by treating purpose-aligned notes as benign unless structured LLM findings contain a material concern, and add targeted rescan batches for suspicious skills/plugins.
- Moderation: split visible ClawScan review guidance from hidden suspicious filtering, and add operator cleanup for stale aggregate rows and obvious test/placeholder suspicious skills.
- Security: add an admin-only moderation hold lift path for false-positive publisher holds, with audited skill restoration that preserves independently hidden skills (#1133) (thanks @Justincredible-tech).
- Moderation: let platform moderators and admins trigger skill/package security rescans for any owner from the CLI, without consuming the owner recovery cap.
- ClawScan: include package `openclaw.environment` env/config declarations in package review prompts so declared plugin runtime requirements are not reported as missing (#2013).
- Skills/Packages: let publisher admins manage owned lifecycle operations consistently, including skill rename/delete/restore, direct skill moves into org publishers they administer, package restore from the CLI/API, and direct moves back to their personal publisher.
- Skills: repair publisher-owned skill merges, bound historical slug redirects, block protected slug namespaces, and expire owner-unpublished slug reservations after 30 days (#2115) (thanks @fuller-stack-dev).
- Skills: allow confirmed owner migration when republishing an existing skill to another publisher, preserving versions, stats, aliases, and audit history (#1998, #2102) (thanks @momothemage).
- Security: block owner delete/undelete paths from overriding moderator or scanner hides, and return explicit 403 authz responses for owner restore denials (#2078) (thanks @momothemage).
- CLI/API: send skill transfer payloads as JSON objects so transfer requests reach the API correctly.
- Packages: keep package search digests schema-safe during delete/restore so package lifecycle CLI calls do not fail after provenance updates.
- Search: recall skill matches by non-first slug/display-name tokens while keeping multi-token queries on the direct recall path constrained to all query tokens (#2140) (thanks @momothemage).
- Search/Web: disclose when `/search` is hiding suspicious skills and add an explicit opt-out so unified search no longer silently differs from `/skills` for the same query (#2079) (thanks @momothemage).
- Uploads: accept PowerShell `.ps1`, `.psm1`, and `.psd1` files as text-based skill files while keeping normal scan coverage (#897) (thanks @cute-omega).
- Packages: count package install stat events separately from package downloads and record npm tarball fetches as installs (#1712).
- Web: keep the Publishers directory responsive for high-volume publishers by using bounded published-item previews, and abort stale unified-search plugin requests during route changes.
- Web: point skill, plugin, and soul owner links directly at canonical `/p/:handle` publisher profiles instead of legacy redirect routes.
- Web/API: ignore stale public skill-list cursors from older sort or safety-filter indexes instead of throwing pagination errors.
- Web: restore dashboard skill metrics for owned skills and use pointer cursors on dropdown menu items (#2113) (thanks @fuller-stack-dev).
- Web: show the skills browse `Hide suspicious` control only when the loaded results include suspicious skills (thanks @vyctorbrzezowski).
- Web: align signed-in header avatar controls across desktop and mobile so the menu trigger keeps consistent sizing, truncation, and dropdown styling (#2124) (thanks @vyctorbrzezowski).
- Web: constrain settings, profile content, skill detail, and plugin detail pages to the header content width while preserving profile hero bleed (thanks @vyctorbrzezowski).
- Web: show publish-page validation next to the relevant fields and upload picker so invalid inputs are not buried below the form (#908) (thanks @AndyZhengyan).
- Docs: remove README references to the inactive onlycrabs.ai domain while leaving the internal SoulHub configuration generic (#951) (thanks @muescha).
- Docs/dev: document the local Convex site proxy URL and make worktree setup reject misconfigured local site URLs that break HTTP routes (#2060) (thanks @vyctorbrzezowski).
- Dev setup: make local seed reset deterministic by cleaning stale seed lookup and badge rows for repeated Convex dev runs (#2057) (thanks @vyctorbrzezowski).

## 0.12.3 - 2026-05-06

## 0.10.0 - 2026-04-05

### Added

- Design system: introduce a shared UI component library (`src/components/ui/`) built on Radix UI primitives — Button, Card, Badge, Tabs, Dialog, Input, Textarea, Label, Select, Avatar, Separator, Tooltip, ScrollArea, Sheet, Skeleton, and Table — following the shadcn/ui pattern with `cn()` + Tailwind utilities.
- Design system: `Button` supports `asChild` via Radix Slot for polymorphic rendering (e.g., wrapping `<Link>` without extra DOM).
- Layout: add `Container` component with `narrow` / `default` / `wide` size presets and `Breadcrumb` component for hierarchical navigation.
- Loading: add skeleton loading states (`SkillCardSkeleton`, `SkillDetailSkeleton`, `DashboardSkeleton`) replacing text-based "Loading..." indicators with animated placeholders.
- Errors: add `ErrorBoundary` with `resetKey` prop that auto-resets on route changes, wired into the root layout.
- Errors: surface fallback messages from Convex API error payloads in mutation/action error toasts.
- UX: add `EmptyState` component with icon, headline, description, and optional CTA action used across dashboard, stars, profile, and publish pages.
- UX: add confirmation dialogs for destructive skill ownership actions (transfer, abandon).
- Markdown: add `MarkdownPreview` component with `react-markdown`, `remark-gfm`, and `react-syntax-highlighter` for rich rendering of skill/plugin READMEs with syntax-highlighted code blocks, GFM tables, and task lists.
- Markdown: render tables with the new `Table` UI primitive for consistent styling across skill docs.
- Navigation: replace DropdownMenu-based mobile nav with a slide-out `Sheet` panel.
- Validation: add Zod schemas (`src/lib/schemas.ts`) for publish-skill, settings, report, and org forms.
- Management: restore capability-tags UI (crypto, requires-wallet, can-make-purchases, etc.) that was silently removed during the initial refactor.
- Management: add `.catch()` error handling with toast feedback on `setSoftDeleted` calls; prompt for hide/restore reasons.

### Changed

- CSS: migrate from a monolithic 5,161-line `styles.css` to Tailwind utilities on components, pruning CSS to ~1,000 lines (81% reduction). Dark mode now uses Tailwind `dark:` variants via a `@variant dark` directive bridging existing CSS custom properties.
- Tailwind: add `@theme` block mapping all CSS design tokens (`--bg`, `--surface`, `--ink`, `--accent`, `--line`, `--radius-*`, etc.) into first-class Tailwind utilities.
- Pages: modernize all route pages (home, skills browse, skill detail, dashboard, settings, publish-skill, publish-plugin, import, about, CLI auth, stars, souls, user profile, org profile, management, plugins browse, plugin detail) from CSS class selectors to Tailwind + UI primitives.
- Skills browse: widen container to `wide` (1400px) for better use of screen space on desktop; same for plugins browse.
- Skills browse: replace text-based filter toggles with pill chips and modernize toolbar layout.
- Skill detail: migrate tab controls from CSS-styled buttons to Radix `Tabs` primitive with proper `role="tab"` accessibility.
- Skill detail: replace inline CSS class-based install card with `SkillInstallCard` using Card + Button primitives.
- Header/Footer: migrate from CSS classes to Tailwind utilities with responsive Sheet-based mobile navigation.
- Dashboard: replace CSS table layout with `Table` UI primitive; add metric cards and skeleton loading.
- Settings: modernize form inputs with `Input`/`Textarea`/`Label` primitives and structured layout.
- Publish: use `Dialog` primitive for modals; inline validation indicators; modernized file list display.

### Fixed

- Auth: `EmptyState` "Sign in" button on publish page now triggers GitHub OAuth via `useAuthActions` instead of linking to non-existent `/signin` route.
- API: fix plugins page dev-mode `{"error":"Only HTML requests are supported here"}` by routing SSR and localhost API fetches directly to the Convex site URL instead of through TanStack Start's request pipeline.
- API: fix CORS error when `credentials: "include"` conflicts with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` by making credentials conditional on same-origin requests.
- API: fix SSR `packageApiUrl` to always use `VITE_CONVEX_SITE_URL` directly, avoiding `getRequestUrl()` failures when SSR request context is unavailable.
- Management: restore `setSoftDeleted` reason parameter for hide/restore actions.
- Tests: rename `settings.test.tsx` to `-settings.test.tsx` to exclude from TanStack Router's file-based route discovery.
- Tests: add `@convex-dev/auth/react` mock for `useAuthActions` in upload route tests.
- Tests: update skill detail tests for Radix tab roles (`role="tab"` instead of `role="button"`), skeleton loading classes (`animate-pulse`), and capability tag data.
- Tests: update skills index tests for refreshed UI copy (placeholder text, empty state wording, loading indicator patterns).
- Tests: update SkillDiffCard tests for Tailwind active-tab class (`shadow-sm` replacing `.is-active`).
- Tests: update packages publish route tests for Tailwind border classes.
- Tests: update packageApi tests for conditional credentials and SSR URL resolution.

## 0.9.0 - 2026-03-23

### Added

- Packages/Plugins: add a first-class OpenClaw package registry across the web app, CLI, and HTTP API. ClawHub now supports package browse/search/detail/version/file/download flows plus `clawhub package explore`, `clawhub package inspect`, and `clawhub package publish` for `skill`, `code-plugin`, and `bundle-plugin` packages. (#1093)
- Packages/Install: package downloads now ship install-ready archives with a `package/` root, support nested files like `dist/index.js`, and work directly with OpenClaw plugin install flows.
- Skills/Web: server-render public skill pages and OG assets for faster first loads, cleaner sharing previews, and better cache behavior.

### Changed

- Browse/Search: rebuild public browse/search around denormalized digests, one-shot HTTP fetches, and deterministic cursors so the homepage and `/skills` are faster, more cacheable, and less likely to hit stale-tab or pagination dead ends.
- Search: default skill search to relevance, keep load-more retryable after fetch failures, and tighten package/skill catalog query paths to reduce inconsistent results under load.

### Fixed

- Packages/Auth: authenticated owners can now list, search, inspect, download, and read files from their own private packages instead of private packages being direct-URL-only. (#1093)
- Packages/API: stabilize package latest-version pointers, cursor pagination, publish outputs, fallback release resolution, and app-origin auth handling so package publish/search/install flows stay reliable.
- Visibility/API: prevent skills owned by deleted/banned users from showing up in public detail pages, browse/search results, or version API routes.
- Skills/API: sanitize public skill and soul version/file reads so hidden or invalid version data does not leak through direct API access.
