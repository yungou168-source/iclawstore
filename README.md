ClawHub is the **public skill registry for OpenClaw**: publish, version, and search text-based agent skills (a `SKILL.md` plus supporting files).
It's designed for fast browsing + a CLI-friendly API, with moderation hooks and vector search.
It also now exposes a native **OpenClaw package catalog** for code plugins and bundle plugins.

## What you can do with it

- Browse skills + render their `SKILL.md`.
- Publish new skill versions with changelogs + tags (including `latest`).
- Rename an owned skill without breaking old links or installs.
- Merge duplicate owned skills into one canonical slug.
- Browse souls + render their `SOUL.md`.
- Publish new soul versions with changelogs + tags.
- Search via embeddings (vector index) instead of brittle keywords.
- Star + comment; admins/mods can curate and approve skills.
- Pin local skill installs so updates and force reinstalls cannot overwrite frozen copies.
- Browse OpenClaw packages with family/trust/capability metadata.
- Publish native code plugins and bundle plugins through `/packages` APIs and CLI flows.

## How it works (high level)

- Web app: TanStack Start (React, Vite/Nitro).
- Backend: Convex (DB + file storage + HTTP actions) + Convex Auth (GitHub OAuth).
- Search: OpenAI embeddings (`text-embedding-3-small`) + Convex vector search.
- API schema + routes: `packages/schema` (`clawhub-schema`).

## CLI

Common CLI flows:

- Auth: `clawhub login`, `clawhub whoami`
- Remote/headless auth: `clawhub login --device`
- Discover: `clawhub search ...`, `clawhub explore`
- Browse unified catalog (skills + plugins): `clawhub package explore`, `clawhub package inspect <name>`
- Manage local installs: `clawhub install <slug>`, `clawhub pin <slug>`, `clawhub unpin <slug>`, `clawhub uninstall <slug>`, `clawhub list`, `clawhub update --all`
- Inspect without installing: `clawhub inspect <slug>`
- Publish/sync skills: `clawhub skill publish <path>`, `clawhub sync`
- Publish plugins: `clawhub package publish <source>`
- Code-plugin manifests must include `openclaw.compat.pluginApi` and `openclaw.build.openclawVersion`; see [`docs/cli.md`](docs/cli.md) for a minimal example.
- Canonicalize owned skills: `clawhub skill rename <slug> <new-slug>`, `clawhub skill merge <source> <target>`

Docs: [`docs/quickstart.md`](docs/quickstart.md), [`docs/cli.md`](docs/cli.md).

### Removal permissions

- `clawhub uninstall <slug>` only removes a local install on your machine.
- Uploaded registry skills use soft-delete/restore (`clawhub delete <slug>` / `clawhub undelete <slug>` or API equivalents).
- Soft-delete/restore is allowed for the skill or package owner, publisher owner/admin, moderators, and admins.
- Packages use `clawhub package delete <name>` / `clawhub package undelete <name>`.
- Hard delete is admin-only (management tools / ban flows).
- Owner rename keeps the old slug as a redirect alias.
- Owner merge hides the source listing and redirects the old slug to the canonical target.

## Telemetry

ClawHub tracks minimal **install telemetry** (to compute install counts) when you run `clawhub sync` while logged in.
Disable via:

```bash
export CLAWHUB_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1
```

Details: [`docs/telemetry.md`](docs/telemetry.md).

## Repo layout

- `src/` — TanStack Start app (routes, components, styles).
- `convex/` — schema + queries/mutations/actions + HTTP API routes.
- `packages/schema/` — shared API types/routes for the CLI and app.
- [`docs/`](docs/README.md) — publishable ClawHub public/operator docs for users, publishers, API clients, and deploy operators.
- [`specs/`](specs/README.md) — product specs, plans, regression notes, and design history.
- [`specs/spec.md`](specs/spec.md) — product + implementation spec (good first read for maintainers).

## Local dev

Prereqs: [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (Convex runs via `bunx`, no global install needed). The detached worktree path also requires [Worktrunk](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk) (`wt`).

```bash
bun install
cp .env.local.example .env.local
# edit .env.local — see CONTRIBUTING.md for local Convex values

# terminal A: local Convex backend
bunx convex dev

# terminal B: web app (port 3000)
bun run dev

# detached/Codex worktree preview
bun run setup:worktree
bun run dev:worktree
wt --yes url

# seed local QA fixtures and the public corpus
bun run seed:dev
```

`bun run seed:dev` waits for the local Convex deployment, runs the dev fixture seed, and refreshes
global stats. The fixtures are owned by `@local` and are safe to rerun after fixture or schema
changes. For reset/manual commands and full setup instructions (env vars, GitHub OAuth, JWT keys,
database seeding), see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Environment

- `VITE_CONVEX_URL`: Convex deployment URL (`https://<deployment>.convex.cloud`).
- `VITE_CONVEX_SITE_URL`: Convex site URL (`https://<deployment>.convex.site`).
- `VITE_SOULHUB_SITE_URL`: SoulHub site URL.
- `VITE_SOULHUB_HOST`: SoulHub host match.
- `VITE_SITE_MODE`: Optional override (`skills` or `souls`) for SSR builds.
- `CONVEX_SITE_URL`: same as `VITE_CONVEX_SITE_URL` (auth + cookies).
- `SITE_URL`: App URL (local: `http://localhost:3000`).
- `AUTH_GITHUB_ID` / `AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET`: GitHub OAuth App.
- `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` / `JWKS`: Convex Auth keys.
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: embeddings for search + indexing.

## Nix plugins (nixmode skills)

ClawHub can store a nix-clawdbot plugin pointer in SKILL frontmatter so the registry knows which
Nix package bundle to install. A nix plugin is different from a regular skill pack: it bundles the
skill pack, the CLI binary, and its config flags/requirements together.

Add this to `SKILL.md`:

```yaml
---
name: peekaboo
description: Capture and automate macOS UI with the Peekaboo CLI.
metadata:
  {
    "clawdbot":
      {
        "nix":
          {
            "plugin": "github:clawdbot/nix-steipete-tools?dir=tools/peekaboo",
            "systems": ["aarch64-darwin"],
          },
      },
  }
---
```

Install via nix-clawdbot:

```nix
programs.clawdbot.plugins = [
  { source = "github:clawdbot/nix-steipete-tools?dir=tools/peekaboo"; }
];
```

You can also declare config requirements + an example snippet:

```yaml
---
name: padel
description: Check padel court availability and manage bookings via Playtomic.
metadata:
  {
    "clawdbot":
      {
        "config":
          {
            "requiredEnv": ["PADEL_AUTH_FILE"],
            "stateDirs": [".config/padel"],
            "example": "config = { env = { PADEL_AUTH_FILE = \\\"/run/agenix/padel-auth\\\"; }; };",
          },
      },
  }
---
```

To show CLI help (recommended for nix plugins), include the `cli --help` output:

```yaml
---
name: padel
description: Check padel court availability and manage bookings via Playtomic.
metadata: { "clawdbot": { "cliHelp": "padel --help\\nUsage: padel [command]\\n" } }
---
```

`metadata.clawdbot` is preferred, but `metadata.clawdis` and `metadata.openclaw` are accepted as aliases.

## Skill metadata

Skills declare their runtime requirements (env vars, binaries, install specs) in the `SKILL.md` frontmatter. ClawHub's security analysis checks these declarations against actual skill behavior; medium review findings stay visible, and the suspicious filter is reserved for high-impact or malicious concerns.

Full reference: [`docs/skill-format.md`](docs/skill-format.md#frontmatter-metadata)

Quick example:

```yaml
---
name: my-skill
description: Does a thing with an API.
metadata:
  openclaw:
    requires:
      env:
        - MY_API_KEY
      bins:
        - curl
    primaryEnv: MY_API_KEY
---
```

## Scripts

```bash
bun run dev
bun run build
bun run test
bun run coverage
bun run lint
```
