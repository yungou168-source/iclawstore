# CLI

CLI package: `clawhub`, bin: `clawhub`.

Install it globally with npm or pnpm:

```bash
npm i -g clawhub
# or
pnpm add -g clawhub
```

Then verify it:

```bash
clawhub --help
clawhub login
clawhub whoami
```

## Global flags

- `--workdir <dir>`: working directory (default: cwd; falls back to Clawdbot workspace if configured)
- `--dir <dir>`: install dir under workdir (default: `skills`)
- `--site <url>`: base URL for browser login (default: `https://clawhub.ai`)
- `--registry <url>`: API base URL (default: discovered, else `https://clawhub.ai`)
- `--no-input`: disable prompts

Env equivalents:

- `CLAWHUB_SITE` (legacy `CLAWDHUB_SITE`)
- `CLAWHUB_REGISTRY` (legacy `CLAWDHUB_REGISTRY`)
- `CLAWHUB_WORKDIR` (legacy `CLAWDHUB_WORKDIR`)

### HTTP proxy

The CLI respects standard HTTP proxy environment variables for systems behind
corporate proxies or restricted networks:

- `HTTPS_PROXY` / `https_proxy`
- `HTTP_PROXY` / `http_proxy`
- `NO_PROXY` / `no_proxy`

When any of these variables is set, the CLI routes outbound requests through
the specified proxy. `HTTPS_PROXY` is used for HTTPS requests, `HTTP_PROXY`
for plain HTTP. `NO_PROXY` / `no_proxy` is respected to bypass the proxy for
specific hosts or domains.

This is required on systems where direct outbound connections are blocked
(e.g. Docker containers, Hetzner VPS with proxy-only internet, corporate
firewalls).

Example:

```bash
export HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:3128
export NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1
clawhub search "my query"
```

When no proxy variable is set, behavior is unchanged (direct connections).

## Config file

Stores your API token + cached registry URL.

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/clawhub/config.json`
- Linux/XDG: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/clawhub/config.json` or `~/.config/clawhub/config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\\clawhub\\config.json`
- Legacy fallback: if `clawhub/config.json` does not exist yet but `clawdhub/config.json` does, the CLI reuses the legacy path
- override: `CLAWHUB_CONFIG_PATH` (legacy `CLAWDHUB_CONFIG_PATH`)

## Commands

### `login` / `auth login`

- Default: opens browser to `<site>/cli/auth` and completes via loopback callback.
- Headless: `clawhub login --token clh_...`
- Remote/headless interactive: `clawhub login --device` prints a code and waits while you authorize it at `<site>/cli/device`.

### `whoami`

- Verifies the stored token via `/api/v1/whoami`.

### `token`

- Prints the stored API token to stdout.
- Useful for piping a local login token into CI secret setup commands.

### `star <slug>` / `unstar <slug>`

- Adds/removes a skill from your highlights.
- Calls `POST /api/v1/stars/<slug>` and `DELETE /api/v1/stars/<slug>`.
- `--yes` skips confirmation.

### `search <query...>`

- Calls `/api/v1/search?q=...`.
- Output includes the skill slug, owner handle, display name, and relevance score.
- Search favors exact slug/name token matches before download popularity. A standalone slug token such as `map` matches `personal-map` more strongly than the substring inside `amap`.
- Downloads are a small popularity prior, not a guarantee of top placement.
- If a skill should appear but does not, run `clawhub inspect <slug>` while logged in to check owner-visible moderation diagnostics before renaming metadata.

### `explore`

- Lists newest skills via `/api/v1/skills?limit=...&sort=createdAt` (sorted by `createdAt` desc).
- Flags:
  - `--limit <n>` (1-200, default: 25)
  - `--sort newest|updated|downloads|rating|installs|installsAllTime|trending` (default: newest)
  - `--json` (machine-readable output)
- Output: `<slug>  v<version>  <age>  <summary>` (summary truncated to 50 chars).

### `inspect <slug>`

- Fetches skill metadata and version files without installing.
- `--version <version>`: inspect a specific version (default: latest).
- `--tag <tag>`: inspect a tagged version (e.g. `latest`).
- `--versions`: list version history (first page).
- `--limit <n>`: max versions to list (1-200).
- `--files`: list files for the selected version.
- `--file <path>`: fetch raw file content (text files only; 200KB limit).
- `--json`: machine-readable output.

### `install <slug>`

- Resolves latest version via `/api/v1/skills/<slug>`.
- Downloads zip via `/api/v1/download`.
- Extracts into `<workdir>/<dir>/<slug>`.
- Refuses to overwrite pinned skills; run `clawhub unpin <slug>` first.
- Writes:
  - `<workdir>/.clawhub/lock.json` (legacy `.clawdhub`)
  - `<skill>/.clawhub/origin.json` (legacy `.clawdhub`)

### `uninstall <slug>`

- Removes `<workdir>/<dir>/<slug>` and deletes the lockfile entry.
- Interactive: asks for confirmation.
- Non-interactive (`--no-input`): requires `--yes`.

### `list`

- Reads `<workdir>/.clawhub/lock.json` (legacy `.clawdhub`).
- Shows `pinned` next to skills frozen with `clawhub pin`, including the optional reason.

### `pin <slug>`

- Marks an installed skill as pinned in the lockfile.
- `--reason <text>` records why the skill is frozen.
- Pinned skills are skipped by `update --all` and rejected by direct `update <slug>`.
- Pinned skills also reject `install --force` so the local bytes cannot be replaced accidentally.

### `unpin <slug>`

- Removes the lockfile pin from an installed skill so future updates can modify it.

### `update [slug]` / `update --all`

- Computes fingerprint from local files.
- If fingerprint matches a known version: no prompt.
- If fingerprint does not match:
  - refuses by default
  - overwrites with `--force` (or prompt, if interactive)
- Pinned skills are never updated by `--force`.
- `update <slug>` fails fast for pinned slugs and tells you to run `clawhub unpin <slug>` first.
- `update --all` skips pinned slugs and prints a summary of what stayed frozen.

### `skill publish <path>`

- Publishes via `POST /api/v1/skills` (multipart).
- Requires semver: `--version 1.2.3`.
- `--owner <handle>` publishes under an org/user publisher handle when the
  actor has publisher access.
- `--migrate-owner` moves an existing skill to `--owner` while publishing a new
  version. Requires admin/owner access on both publishers.
- Owner and review behavior is explained in `docs/publishing.md`.
- Publishing a skill means it is released under `MIT-0` on ClawHub.
- Published skills are free to use, modify, and redistribute without attribution.
- ClawHub does not support paid skills or per-skill pricing.
- Legacy alias: `publish <path>`.

```bash
clawhub skill publish ./my-skill --version 1.0.0
```

### `scan --slug <slug>`

- Requires `clawhub login`.
- Runs ClawHub ClawScan through `POST /api/v1/skills/-/scan`, then polls until the scan is terminal.
- Scans are asynchronous and may take time to complete. While queued, the terminal spinner shows the current prioritized scan position and how many scans are ahead.
- Published scans require ownership or publisher management access. Moderators/admins can use the same backend through `clawhub-mod`.
- `--update` is valid only with `--slug`; it writes successful published scan results back to the selected version.
- `--output <file.zip>` downloads the full report archive with `manifest.json`, `clawscan.json`, `skillspector.json`, `static-analysis.json`, `virustotal.json`, and `README.md`.
- `--json` prints the full poll response for automation.
- Local path scans are no longer supported. Upload a new version, then use `scan download` to retrieve the stored scan results for that submitted version.

```bash
clawhub scan --slug gifgrep
clawhub scan --slug gifgrep --version 1.2.3
clawhub scan --slug gifgrep --update --output report.zip
```

### `scan download <name>`

- Requires `clawhub login`.
- Downloads the stored scan report ZIP for a submitted skill or plugin version, including versions that were blocked or hidden by ClawHub security checks.
- Skill downloads use the skill slug and default to `--kind skill`.
- Plugin downloads use the package name and require `--kind plugin`.
- `--version` is required so authors inspect the exact submitted version that ClawHub blocked.
- `--output <file.zip>` chooses the destination path.

```bash
clawhub scan download gifgrep --version 1.2.3
clawhub scan download @scope/demo --version 2.0.0 --kind plugin --output report.zip
```

#### GitHub Actions

ClawHub ships an official reusable workflow at
[`/.github/workflows/skill-publish.yml`](../.github/workflows/skill-publish.yml)
for skill repos and catalog repos.

Typical catalog setup:

```yaml
name: Skill Publish

on:
  pull_request:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  dry-run:
    if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
    uses: openclaw/clawhub/.github/workflows/skill-publish.yml@v1
    with:
      owner: nvidia
      dry_run: true

  publish:
    if: github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch'
    uses: openclaw/clawhub/.github/workflows/skill-publish.yml@v1
    with:
      owner: nvidia
      dry_run: false
    secrets:
      clawhub_token: ${{ secrets.CLAWHUB_TOKEN }}
```

Notes:

- `root` defaults to `skills` for catalog repos.
- Pass `skill_path: skills/review-helper` to process one skill folder.
- `owner` maps to the CLI `--owner` flag; omit it to publish as the authenticated user.
- V1 skill publishing uses `clawhub_token`; GitHub OIDC trusted publishing is package-only for now.

### `delete <slug>`

- Soft-delete a skill (owner, moderator, or admin).
- Calls `DELETE /api/v1/skills/{slug}`.
- Owner-initiated soft deletes reserve the slug for 30 days; the command prints the expiry time.
- `--reason <text>` records a moderation note on the skill and audit log.
- `--note <text>` is an alias for `--reason`.
- `--yes` skips confirmation.

### `undelete <slug>`

- Restore a hidden skill (owner, moderator, or admin).
- Calls `POST /api/v1/skills/{slug}/undelete`.
- `--reason <text>` records a moderation note on the skill and audit log.
- `--note <text>` is an alias for `--reason`.
- `--yes` skips confirmation.

### `hide <slug>`

- Hide a skill (owner, moderator, or admin).
- Alias for `delete`.

### `unhide <slug>`

- Unhide a skill (owner, moderator, or admin).
- Alias for `undelete`.

### `skill rename <slug> <new-slug>`

- Rename an owned skill and keep the previous slug as a redirect alias.
- Calls `POST /api/v1/skills/{slug}/rename`.
- `--yes` skips confirmation.

### `skill merge <source-slug> <target-slug>`

- Merge one owned skill into another owned skill.
- The source slug stops listing publicly and becomes a redirect alias to the target.
- Calls `POST /api/v1/skills/{sourceSlug}/merge`.
- `--yes` skips confirmation.

### `transfer`

- Ownership transfer workflow.
- Transfers to user handles create a pending request that the recipient accepts.
- Transfers to org/publisher handles apply immediately only when the actor has
  admin access to both the current owner and destination publisher.
- Subcommands:
  - `transfer request <slug> <handle> [--message "..."] [--yes]`
  - `transfer list [--outgoing]`
  - `transfer accept <slug> [--yes]`
  - `transfer reject <slug> [--yes]`
  - `transfer cancel <slug> [--yes]`
- Endpoints:
  - `POST /api/v1/skills/{slug}/transfer`
  - `POST /api/v1/skills/{slug}/transfer/accept`
  - `POST /api/v1/skills/{slug}/transfer/reject`
  - `POST /api/v1/skills/{slug}/transfer/cancel`
  - `GET /api/v1/transfers/incoming`
  - `GET /api/v1/transfers/outgoing`

### `package explore [query...]`

- Browses or searches the unified package catalog via `GET /api/v1/packages` and `GET /api/v1/packages/search`.
- Use this for plugins and other package-family entries; top-level `search` remains the skill search surface.
- Flags:
  - `--family skill|code-plugin|bundle-plugin`
  - `--official`
  - `--executes-code`
  - `--target <target>`, `--os <os>`, `--arch <arch>`, `--libc <libc>`
  - `--requires-browser`, `--requires-desktop`, `--requires-native-deps`
  - `--requires-external-service`, `--external-service <name>`
  - `--binary <name>`, `--os-permission <name>`
  - `--artifact-kind legacy-zip|npm-pack`
  - `--npm-mirror`
  - `--limit <n>` (1-100, default: 25)
  - `--json`

Examples:

```bash
clawhub package explore --family code-plugin
clawhub package explore --family code-plugin --os darwin --requires-desktop
clawhub package explore --family code-plugin --artifact-kind npm-pack
clawhub package explore --npm-mirror
clawhub package explore episodic-claw --family code-plugin
```

### `package inspect <name>`

- Fetches package metadata without installing.
- Use this for plugin metadata, compatibility, verification, source, and version/file inspection.
- `--version <version>`: inspect a specific version (default: latest).
- `--tag <tag>`: inspect a tagged version (e.g. `latest`).
- `--versions`: list version history (first page).
- `--limit <n>`: max versions to list (1-100).
- `--files`: list files for the selected version.
- `--file <path>`: fetch raw file content (text files only; 200KB limit).
- `--json`: machine-readable output.

### `package download <name>`

- Resolves a package version through
  `GET /api/v1/packages/{name}/versions/{version}/artifact`.
- Downloads the artifact from the resolver's `downloadUrl`.
- Verifies ClawHub SHA-256 for all artifacts.
- For ClawPack npm-pack artifacts, also verifies npm `sha512` integrity,
  npm shasum, and the tarball's `package.json` name/version.
- Legacy ZIP versions download through the legacy ZIP route.
- Flags:
  - `--version <version>`: download a specific version.
  - `--tag <tag>`: download a tagged version (default: `latest`).
  - `-o, --output <path>`: output file or directory.
  - `--force`: overwrite an existing output file.
  - `--json`: machine-readable output.

Examples:

```bash
clawhub package download @openclaw/example-plugin --tag latest
clawhub package download @openclaw/example-plugin --version 1.2.3 -o artifacts/
```

### `package verify <file>`

- Computes ClawHub SHA-256, npm `sha512` integrity, and npm shasum for a local
  artifact.
- With `--package`, resolves expected metadata from ClawHub and compares the
  local file against the published artifact metadata.
- With direct digest flags, verifies without a network lookup.
- Flags:
  - `--package <name>`: package name to resolve expected artifact metadata.
  - `--version <version>` or `--tag <tag>`: expected package version.
  - `--sha256 <hex>`: expected ClawHub SHA-256.
  - `--npm-integrity <sri>`: expected npm integrity.
  - `--npm-shasum <sha1>`: expected npm shasum.
  - `--json`: machine-readable output.

Examples:

```bash
clawhub package verify ./example-plugin-1.2.3.tgz --package @openclaw/example-plugin --version 1.2.3
clawhub package verify ./example-plugin-1.2.3.tgz --sha256 <hex>
```

### `package validate <source>`

- Runs the ClawHub CLI's bundled Plugin Inspector against a local plugin package
  folder.
- Defaults to offline/static validation, without locating or importing a local
  OpenClaw checkout.
- Hard compatibility errors exit non-zero. Warning-only findings are printed but
  exit zero.
- Flags:
  - `--out <dir>`: write Plugin Inspector reports to this directory.
  - `--openclaw <path>`: inspect against an explicit local OpenClaw checkout.
  - `--runtime`: enable runtime capture; imports plugin code.
  - `--allow-execute`: allow runtime capture in an isolated workspace.
  - `--no-mock-sdk`: disable mocked OpenClaw SDK during runtime capture.
  - `--json`: machine-readable output.

Example:

```bash
clawhub package validate ./example-plugin
```

### `package delete <name>`

- Soft-deletes a package and all releases.
- Requires the package owner, an org publisher owner/admin, platform moderator,
  or platform admin.
- Flags:
  - `--yes`: skip confirmation.
  - `--json`: machine-readable output.

Example:

```bash
clawhub package delete @openclaw/example-plugin --yes
```

### `package undelete <name>`

- Restores a soft-deleted package and releases.
- Requires the package owner, an org publisher owner/admin, platform moderator,
  or platform admin.
- Calls `POST /api/v1/packages/{name}/undelete`.
- Flags:
  - `--yes`: skip confirmation.
  - `--json`: machine-readable output.

Example:

```bash
clawhub package undelete @openclaw/example-plugin --yes
```

### `package transfer <name>`

- Transfers a package to another publisher.
- Requires admin access to both the current package owner and destination
  publisher, unless performed by a platform admin.
- Scoped package names must transfer to the matching scope owner.
- Calls `POST /api/v1/packages/{name}/transfer`.
- Flags:
  - `--to <owner>`: destination publisher handle.
  - `--reason <text>`: optional audit reason.
  - `--json`: machine-readable output.

Example:

```bash
clawhub package transfer @openclaw/example-plugin --to openclaw
```

### `package report`

- Authenticated command for reporting a package to moderators.
- Calls `POST /api/v1/packages/{name}/report`.
- Reports are package-level, optionally tied to a version, and become visible
  to moderators for review.
- Reports do not auto-hide packages or block downloads by themselves.
- Flags:
  - `--version <version>`: optional package version to attach to the report.
  - `--reason <text>`: required report reason.
  - `--json`: machine-readable output.

Example:

```bash
clawhub package report @openclaw/example-plugin --version 1.2.3 --reason "suspicious native payload"
```

### `package moderation-status`

- Owner command for checking package moderation visibility.
- Calls `GET /api/v1/packages/{name}/moderation`.
- Shows current package scan state, open report count, latest release manual
  moderation state, download block state, and moderation reasons.
- Flags:
  - `--json`: machine-readable output.

Example:

```bash
clawhub package moderation-status @openclaw/example-plugin
```

### `package readiness <name>`

- Checks whether a package is ready for future OpenClaw consumption.
- Calls `GET /api/v1/packages/{name}/readiness`.
- Reports blockers for official status, ClawPack availability, artifact digest,
  source provenance, OpenClaw compatibility, host targets, environment metadata,
  and scan state.
- Flags:
  - `--json`: machine-readable output.

Example:

```bash
clawhub package readiness @openclaw/example-plugin
```

### `package migration-status <name>`

- Shows operator-oriented migration status for a package that may replace a
  bundled OpenClaw plugin.
- Calls the same computed readiness endpoint as `package readiness`, but prints
  migration-focused status, latest version, official-package state, checks, and
  blockers.
- Flags:
  - `--json`: machine-readable output.

Example:

```bash
clawhub package migration-status @openclaw/example-plugin
```

### `publisher create <handle>`

- Creates an org publisher owned by the authenticated user.
- The handle is normalized to lowercase and may be passed with or without `@`.
- Newly created org publishers are not trusted/official by default.
- Fails if the handle is already used by an existing publisher, user, or reserved route.

```bash
clawhub publisher create opik --display-name "Opik"
```

### `package publish <source>`

- Publishes a code plugin or bundle plugin via `POST /api/v1/packages`.
- `<source>` accepts:
  - Local folder path: `./my-plugin`
  - Local ClawPack npm-pack tarball: `./my-plugin-1.2.3.tgz`
  - GitHub repo: `owner/repo` or `owner/repo@ref`
  - GitHub URL: `https://github.com/owner/repo`
- Metadata is auto-detected from `package.json`, `openclaw.plugin.json`, and
  real OpenClaw bundle markers such as `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`,
  `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, and `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`.
- `.tgz` sources are treated as ClawPack. The CLI uploads the exact npm-pack
  bytes and uses the extracted `package/` contents only for validation and
  metadata prefill.
- Code-plugin folders are packed into a ClawPack npm tarball before upload so
  OpenClaw installs can verify the exact artifact. Bundle-plugin folders still
  use the extracted-file publish path.
- For GitHub sources, source attribution is auto-populated from the repo, resolved commit, ref, and subpath.
- For local folders, source attribution is auto-detected from local git when the origin remote points at GitHub.
- External code plugins must declare `openclaw.compat.pluginApi` and
  `openclaw.build.openclawVersion` explicitly.
  Top-level `package.json.version` is not used as a fallback for publish validation.
- `--dry-run` previews the resolved publish payload without uploading.
- `--json` emits machine-readable output for CI.
- `--owner <handle>` publishes under a user or org publisher handle when the actor has publisher access.
- Scoped package names must match the selected owner. See `docs/publishing.md`.
- Existing flags (`--family`, `--name`, `--version`, `--source-repo`, `--source-commit`, `--source-ref`, `--source-path`) still work as overrides.
- Private GitHub repos require `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

```bash
clawhub package publish ./plugin.tgz --owner openclaw
```

#### Recommended local flow

Use `--dry-run` first so you can confirm the resolved package metadata and
source attribution before creating a live release:

```bash
npm pack
clawhub package publish ./my-plugin-1.2.3.tgz --family code-plugin --dry-run
clawhub package publish ./my-plugin-1.2.3.tgz --family code-plugin
```

#### Local folder flow

For code plugins, folder publish builds and uploads a ClawPack artifact from
the package folder:

```bash
clawhub package publish ./my-plugin --family code-plugin --dry-run
clawhub package publish ./my-plugin --family code-plugin
```

#### Minimal `package.json` for `--family code-plugin`

External code plugins need a small amount of OpenClaw metadata in
`package.json`. This minimal manifest is enough for a successful publish:

```json
{
  "name": "@myorg/openclaw-my-plugin",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "type": "module",
  "openclaw": {
    "extensions": ["./index.ts"],
    "compat": {
      "pluginApi": ">=2026.3.24-beta.2"
    },
    "build": {
      "openclawVersion": "2026.3.24-beta.2"
    }
  }
}
```

Required fields:

- `openclaw.compat.pluginApi`
- `openclaw.build.openclawVersion`

Notes:

- `package.json.version` is your package release version, but it is not used as
  a fallback for OpenClaw compatibility/build validation.
- `openclaw.hostTargets` and `openclaw.environment` are optional metadata.
  ClawHub may surface them when present, but they are not required for publish.
- `openclaw.compat.minGatewayVersion` and
  `openclaw.build.pluginSdkVersion` are optional extras if you want to publish
  more detailed compatibility metadata.
- If you are using an older `clawhub` CLI release, upgrade before publishing so
  the local preflight checks run before upload.

#### GitHub Actions

ClawHub also ships an official reusable workflow at
[`/.github/workflows/package-publish.yml`](../.github/workflows/package-publish.yml)
for plugin repos.

Typical caller setup:

```yaml
name: Package Publish

on:
  pull_request:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    tags:
      - "v*"

jobs:
  dry-run:
    if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
    uses: openclaw/clawhub/.github/workflows/package-publish.yml@v0.12.0
    with:
      dry_run: true

  publish:
    if: github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch' || startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')
    permissions:
      contents: read
      id-token: write
    uses: openclaw/clawhub/.github/workflows/package-publish.yml@v0.12.0
    with:
      dry_run: false
    secrets:
      clawhub_token: ${{ secrets.CLAWHUB_TOKEN }}
```

Notes:

- The reusable workflow defaults `source` to the caller repo.
- For monorepos, pass `source_path` so the workflow publishes the plugin
  package folder, for example `source_path: extensions/codex`.
- Pin the reusable workflow to a stable tag or full commit SHA. Do not run release publishing from `@main`.
- `pull_request` should use `dry_run: true` so CI stays non-polluting.
- Real publishes should be limited to trusted events such as `workflow_dispatch` or tag pushes.
- Trusted publishing without a secret only works on `workflow_dispatch`; tag pushes still need `clawhub_token`.
- Keep `clawhub_token` available for first publish, untrusted packages, or break-glass publishes.
- The workflow uploads the JSON result as an artifact and exposes it as workflow outputs.

### `sync`

- Scans for local skill folders and publishes new/changed ones.
- Roots can be any folder: a skills directory or a single skill folder with `SKILL.md`.
- Auto-adds Clawdbot skill roots when `~/.clawdbot/clawdbot.json` is present:
  - `agent.workspace/skills` (main agent)
  - `routing.agents.*.workspace/skills` (per-agent)
  - `~/.clawdbot/skills` (shared)
  - `skills.load.extraDirs` (shared packs)
- Respects `CLAWDBOT_CONFIG_PATH` / `CLAWDBOT_STATE_DIR` and `OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH` / `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR`.
- Flags:
  - `--root <dir...>` extra scan roots
  - `--all` upload without prompting
  - `--dry-run` show plan only
  - `--json` machine-readable summary for CI
  - `--owner <handle>` publish under a user or org publisher
  - `--bump patch|minor|major` (default: patch)
  - `--changelog <text>` (non-interactive)
  - `--tags a,b,c` (default: latest)
  - `--concurrency <n>` (default: 4)
  - `--source-repo <repo>`, `--source-commit <sha>`, `--source-ref <ref>` for GitHub provenance

Telemetry:

- Sent during `sync` when logged in, unless `CLAWHUB_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1` (legacy `CLAWDHUB_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1`).
- Details: `docs/telemetry.md`.
