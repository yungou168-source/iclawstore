# Telemetry

ClawHub uses **minimal telemetry** to compute **install counts** (what’s actually in use) and to power better sorting/filtering.
This is based on the CLI `clawhub sync` command.

## When telemetry is collected

Telemetry is only sent when:

- You are **logged in** in the CLI (we already require auth for sync/publish flows).
- You run `clawhub sync`.
- Telemetry is **not disabled** (see “How to disable” below).

If you are not logged in, nothing is reported.

## What we collect

On each `clawhub sync`, the CLI reports a **full snapshot** of what it found, grouped by scan root (“folder/root”).

For each root we store:

- `rootId`: a **SHA-256 hash** of the canonical root path (server never sees the raw path).
- `label`: a human-readable label derived from the last two path segments (home paths are shown with `~`).
- `firstSeenAt`, `lastSeenAt`, optional `expiredAt`.

For each skill found under a root we store:

- `skillId` (resolved by slug; only skills that exist in the registry are tracked).
- `firstSeenAt`, `lastSeenAt`.
- `lastVersion` (best-effort; currently the registry-matched version if known).
- optional `removedAt` when a previously-reported install disappears from a root.

### What we do _not_ collect

- No raw absolute folder paths (only hashed `rootId` + a short display label).
- No file contents.
- No per-run logs, prompts, or other CLI output.
- No tracking for skills that aren’t uploaded to the registry (unknown slugs are ignored).

## Install counts

We maintain two counters per skill:

- `installsCurrent`: unique users who currently have the skill installed in at least one active root.
- `installsAllTime`: unique users who have ever reported the skill installed.

### Multiple roots

If you sync from multiple folders, we treat each scan root independently. A skill is “currently installed” if it exists in **any** active root.

### Uninstall detection

Because `sync` reports the full set per root:

- If a skill disappears from a root on the next sync, we mark it removed for that root.
- If the skill is removed from all of your roots, it no longer counts toward `installsCurrent`.
- `installsAllTime` never decreases unless you delete telemetry (see below).

### Staleness (120 days)

Roots that don’t report telemetry for **120 days** are marked stale and their installs stop counting toward `installsCurrent`.
This is evaluated lazily (on the next telemetry report) to avoid background jobs.

## Transparency + user controls

ClawHub provides a private “Installed” tab on your own profile:

- Shows the exact roots + installed skills we store.
- Includes a **JSON export** view.
- Includes a **Delete telemetry** action to remove all stored telemetry for your account.

Everyone else only sees **aggregated install counters**; no one else can see your roots/folders.

Deleting your account also deletes your telemetry data.

## How to disable telemetry

Set the environment variable:

```bash
export CLAWHUB_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1
```

With this set, the CLI will not send telemetry during `clawhub sync`.
