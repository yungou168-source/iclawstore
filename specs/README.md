# Specs

`specs/` holds maintainer-only or non-navigated records that should not publish
to the public ClawHub docs tab by default.

Use this folder for:

- Product and implementation specs.
- Forward-looking plans and migration notes.
- Regression notes and design history.
- Maintainer validation or CI policy records.
- Cross-repo extraction notes that reviewers need but users do not.

Public/user/operator docs belong in `docs/`. If a spec graduates into something
users should read on `docs.openclaw.ai`, move or summarize the public material
into `docs/` and leave only the design record here.
